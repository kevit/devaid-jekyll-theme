                    When I first started my previous company I couldn't afford Facebook Ads, Mixpanel and Intercom.
                    Slowly we added all of those tools + more. But my data was messy and I spent a lot of time integrating, checking APIs and settled on starting over with each tool. <br /><br />Grand is a 1 time integration for everything you will ever use, and we save your data to make getting new tools up and running easy.
